## Goal:

The goal is to build a machine learning model for predicting solar power of a solar panel installation.

Getting a prediction for the comming days on a periodic basis of eg. 15min, will enable us to optimize our energy consumption by automating and controling our "home" consumers. For example, based on this info, we could decide not to load our battery system during night but during the day with the excess of solar power. Or decide to start the dish washer because we expect enough solar during the duration of his washing cycle.

This ML model will be the bases of a public API that systems can consult.
